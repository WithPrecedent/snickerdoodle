# Securely publishes the repository on PyPI

# This code is adapted  from the model Action in the PDM documentation:
# https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/usage/publish/

# To make this action work, you need to configure PyPI properly, using this
# guide: https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/

# This Action does not build the project - it simply publishes the contents of
# the ".pdm-build" folder.
